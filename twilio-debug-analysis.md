# Twilio Voice Agent Debug Analysis

## Key Findings

### 1. The Critical Issue
The personalized greeting is not triggering because `currentStreamSid` is already set when media events arrive.

**Debug Output:**
```json
{
  "incomingStreamSid": "MZ7a6a729f775e7480dfc3e4bd5f7a0345",
  "currentStreamSid": "MZ7a6a729f775e7480dfc3e4bd5f7a0345",  // Already set!
  "willTriggerGreeting": false,  // This is why no greeting
  "hasUserData": true,
  "userName": "Chris Kohout"
}
```

### 2. Flow of Events

1. **Webhook receives call** (CallSid: CAccb5d508ca34d8ecd75f55808c49fa02)
   - User lookup successful: "Chris Kohout" found
   - Data stored in DO storage
   - `currentStreamSid` is reset to `undefined`

2. **WebSocket connection established**
   - User data available
   - CallSid extracted from path successfully
   - Services should initialize here

3. **Media events arrive** (streamSid: MZ7a6a729f775e7480dfc3e4bd5f7a0345)
   - BUT: `currentStreamSid` is already set to this value
   - Condition `streamSid && !this.currentStreamSid` fails
   - No greeting is triggered

### 3. Root Cause
The `currentStreamSid` is being set somewhere else before our media event handler runs. This could be happening in:
- The parent class `onMessage` handler
- Another event handler processing a "start" event we're not seeing in logs
- The stream detection logic in the base class

### 4. Services Not Initialized
- Deepgram session is never connected
- TTS service is likely not initialized either
- The `onStart()` method is never called

### 5. What Should Happen
1. WebSocket connects
2. Services initialize (`onStart()` called)
3. First media event arrives with streamSid
4. Greeting triggers: "Hello Chris! I'm Kaylee. How can I help you today?"
5. Audio flows both ways

### 6. Solution Approaches

#### Option 1: Force greeting on WebSocket connection (Current attempt)
- Added timeout to send greeting 1 second after WebSocket connects
- Should bypass the stream detection issue
- But services still need to be initialized

#### Option 2: Always trigger on first media event
- Change condition from `!this.currentStreamSid` to check a separate flag
- Add a `greetingSent` flag instead of relying on streamSid

#### Option 3: Initialize services immediately
- Call `onStart()` in the webhook handler
- Ensure services are ready before WebSocket even connects

## Raw Data Patterns

### Twilio Media Event Structure
```json
{
  "event": "media",
  "sequenceNumber": "51",
  "media": {
    "track": "inbound",
    "chunk": "50",
    "timestamp": "1075",
    "payload": "//////////////////////////..." // Base64 audio data (silence)
  },
  "streamSid": "MZ7a6a729f775e7480dfc3e4bd5f7a0345"
}
```

### Issues Observed
1. No "start" event received (should contain streamSid initially)
2. Media events have silence payload (all forward slashes = silence)
3. Services never initialize
4. Deepgram repeatedly fails to connect

## Next Steps
1. Check if the WebSocket greeting timeout is actually firing
2. Verify `onStart()` is being called
3. Add more logging to track where `currentStreamSid` gets set
4. Consider using a different flag for greeting instead of streamSid
